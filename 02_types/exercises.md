Okay, here are some exercises to practice working with collections in Dart. I'll provide 5 exercises for Lists, 5 for Sets, and 5 for Maps:

Lists

Exercise 1: Basic List Operations

Create a List of strings containing the names of five different fruits.
Print the first and the last element of the list.
Add a new fruit to the end of the list.
Insert a fruit at the beginning of the list.
Print the updated list.
Exercise 2: Filtering and Transforming a List

Create a List of integers from 1 to 10.
Create a new List containing only the even numbers from the original list using the where() method.
Create another new List where each element of the original list is doubled using the map() method.
Print both new lists.
Exercise 3: Checking List Properties

Create a List of booleans: [true, false, true, true, false].
Check if the list is empty. Print the result.
Get the length of the list and print it.
Check if the list contains the value false. Print the result.
Check if all elements in the list are true using the every() method. Print the result.
Exercise 4: Modifying List Elements

Create a List of numbers: [10, 20, 30, 40, 50].
Increase each element in the list by 5 using a loop.
Replace the element at index 2 with the value 35.
Print the modified list.
Exercise 5: Finding Elements in a List

Create a List of strings: ['apple', 'banana', 'orange', 'grape', 'banana'].
Find the index of the first occurrence of the string 'banana'. Print the index.
Find the index of the last occurrence of the string 'banana'. Print the index.
Check if the list contains the string 'kiwi'. Print the result.
Sets

Exercise 1: Basic Set Operations

Create a Set of integers containing the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.
Print the set.
Add the number 6 to the set.
Try to add the number 3 again. Print the set and observe the result.
Remove the number 4 from the set.
Print the updated set.
Exercise 2: Set Membership

Create a Set of strings: {'red', 'green', 'blue'}.
Check if the set contains the string 'green'. Print the result.
Check if the set contains the string 'yellow'. Print the result.
Exercise 3: Set Operations - Union and Intersection

Create two Sets of integers: set1 = {1, 2, 3} and set2 = {3, 4, 5}.
Find the union of set1 and set2. Print the result.
Find the intersection of set1 and set2. Print the result.
Exercise 4: Set Difference

Create two Sets of strings: setA = {'a', 'b', 'c', 'd'} and setB = {'c', 'd', 'e'}.
Find the difference between setA and setB (elements in setA but not in setB). Print the result.
Find the difference between setB and setA (elements in setB but not in setA). Print the result.
Exercise 5: Iterating Through a Set

Create a Set of doubles: {3.14, 2.71, 1.618}.
Iterate through the set and print each element.
Maps

Exercise 1: Basic Map Operations

Create a Map where keys are strings (student names) and values are integers (their ages). Add at least three entries.
Print the entire map.
Print the age of a specific student (by accessing the value using their name as the key).
Add a new student and their age to the map.
Update the age of an existing student.
Print the updated map.
Exercise 2: Accessing Keys and Values

Create a Map: {'country': 'Argentina', 'capital': 'Buenos Aires', 'currency': 'ARS'}.
Get all the keys of the map and print them as a List.
Get all the values of the map and print them as a List.
Exercise 3: Checking Map Properties

Create a Map: {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}.
Check if the map is empty. Print the result.
Get the number of key-value pairs in the map and print it.
Check if the map contains the key 'b'. Print the result.
Check if the map contains the value 3. Print the result.
Exercise 4: Removing Elements from a Map

Create a Map: {'product1': 10.99, 'product2': 5.50, 'product3': 20.00}.
Remove the entry with the key 'product2'.
Print the updated map.
Clear all entries from the map.
Print the map to confirm it's empty.
Exercise 5: Iterating Through a Map

Create a Map: {'one': 1, 'two': 2, 'three': 3}.
Iterate through the map and print each key-value pair in the format "key: value". You can use the forEach method or iterate through entries.
These exercises should give you a good foundation for working with different types of collections in Dart. Try to solve them on your own and refer to the Dart documentation if you get stuck! Good luck!
